# Development tools

## Programming language
### C++
C++17 is our language of choice
#### Pros and cons of C++ compared to C
Pros:
* Allows for greater level of abstraction, the code is much cleaner.
* Easier to express ideas through code implementation.
* More features that allow for writing safe code.
* It is as fast as C or sometimes even faster.

Cons:
* It may be harder for unexperienced programmers to write code without overhead compared to C.
* It's complexity may be overwhelming for new programmers.
* Harder to refactor code.

## CMake
CMake is a cross-platform free and open-source software tool for managing the build process of software using a compiler-independent method.

It helps with cross-compilation of C++ and C code and allows for library linking such that
it is possible to include libraries without specyfing the whole path.

## STM32CubeMX
A graphical tool used for microcontroller configuration. It speeds up development process by generating files with all the necessary initialization code.
